To run:
- Make sure dependencies from the dependencies.txt are installed
    -I did not include a script to auto download dependencies, nor included the venv
- run gui.py

- Main screen is going to allow for 3 buttons, each one representing a different way that we have implemented
  the Vehicle Routing Problem in practice

  - First button is standard
    - Finds the highest dollar per mile stop, and goes there first
    - Finds shortest route to every stop listed for that vehicle
    - Returns to the depot.
    - This is iterated for two vehicles to show the process

  - Second button is when the two vehicles are limited to 3 stops
    - This is basically a greedy algorithm, it finds the highest value stops that are currently on
      a specific vehicles route and chooses that stop to go to next.
    - Distance is not a factor in this iteration

  - Third button is pure shortest path, which is what we implemented in my internship.
    - Each vehicle leaves the depot at ~the same time
    - Finds the shortest distance node and moves through them until no nodes remain and then return to the depot

- All nodes are considered connected for simplicities sake, but can implement roads and non-euclidean distances

- All algorithms use a greedy approach for finding the shortest distance. In our practice in industry, we used
a Neural Network to calculate the least possible distance and time using traffic pattern data and created the
routes that way.
